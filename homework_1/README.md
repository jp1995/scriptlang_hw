# Homework 1

**********************

What’s the difference between repository and branch in git?

A repository is a whole project, a branch is an independent version of a repository. A repository always has at least one branch.

What’s the staging environment and how does it relate to a commit?

Files that are in the staging environment are going to be part of the next commit. The ```git add``` command is used to add files to the staging environment.
